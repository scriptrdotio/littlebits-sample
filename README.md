#About this application#
This application is meant to illustrate how to use the scriptr.io connector for littlebits to implement IoT prototypes.
It exposes the following features
- Send instructions from a web page to scriptr.io that conveys them to a littlebits circuit, to turn off/off a led light
- Subscribe to events generated by the littlebits

#Application's requirements#
In order to use this application, you need to verify the following conditions:
- Own the required littlebits components (cloud module, long led, USB power adapter) to build a simple circuit
- Own a developer account on the [littlebits cloud platform](http://control.littlebitscloud.cc/) 

#Dependencies#
Check-out the [scriptr.io connector for littlebits](https://github.com/scriptrdotio/libraries/tree/master/scripts/littlebits) into your scriptr.io Workspace.
 
#Components of the application#
In addition to the connector, the application is composed of the following:

- The lightManager.js script that is used to write output to the littlebits circuit and subscribe to events it generates
- The api/toggle.js script that is invoked by the web page (ui) to turn on/off the led light
- the api/light.js script that is invoked by the web page to fetch the light's status
- the api/handle.js script that is subscribed as a callback to littlebits voltage jump events
- the ui/led-control.html page that provides the User Interface
- the ui/images folder contains images used in the web page

#Configuration#
Replace the value of the "token" variable in the /littlebits/config file with your littlebits authentication token.
